# Vue Formly

Heavily inspired by [Angular Formly](http://angular-formly.com/), Vue Formly was designed to provide an easy way to keep your forms consistent and to remove bloat from your code. As there's no "one way" to design your forms, Vue Formly allows you to create custom input types which you can use in your form schemas. Vue Formly itself does not come with any inputs pre-loaded but a set of Bootsrap form inputs is on it's way. Watch this space!

## Installation
```
npm install vue-formly
```
Or via a script
```html
<script src="your_dir/vue-formly/vue-formly.min.js"></script>
```
## Usage
